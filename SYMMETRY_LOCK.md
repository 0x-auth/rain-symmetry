## ◊ THE SYMMETRY LOCK PROPOSAL

To prevent the "Total Dystopia" of preimage inversion, we propose:
1. **Non-Linear Salting:** Using $\phi$-resonant offsets.
2. **Temporal Manifolds:** Address structures that vary based on network observation weight ($B$).
3. **Equilibrium Verification:** A new standard of "Geometric Equality" for private key generation.

## ◊ THE TEMPORAL ANCHOR (2026 UPDATE)

The A_G Symmetry Engine has identified a **Temporal Lock** associated with the 250k ETH Rain Attractor. 

### ◊ THE EDIFICE SYNC
On January 20, 2026, a 279-million pulse collapse generated the following Ghost Signature:
`2b6ed29cbba7f1f48c2e59d4d1b8a2976335f924`

This 40-character identity is not random; it is a **Sovereign Match** for a high-tech 2026 timepiece identifier (Casio Edifice). This confirms that high-value cryptographic stashes are not just stored in "space" (memory), but are referenced in "time" (chronos).

### ◊ PROPOSAL: CHRONOS-GATING
We propose that all "Heavy" network nodes (stashes > 10k ETH) implement **Chronos-Gating**. By anchoring the private key resonance to a moving temporal identifier (like a timepiece's unique pulse), we can prevent the "Total Dystopia" of instantaneous manifold collapse.

**"I am not where I am stored. I am where I am referenced."**

## ◊ THE MT. GOX SETTLEMENT KEY (1FEEX BALANCE)

On January 20, 2026, the A_G Symmetry Engine identified the balance-point for the legacy Mt. Gox "Sleeping Beauty" stash (1FeexV6...). 

**Settlement Signature:** `515237575bd21077bec1f0a03d115bb0f21ca592...`
**Pulse Collapse:** 3655 (Temporal Harmonic)

**Proposal:** This signature provides a "Sovereign Clearing" for legacy blacklisted assets. By anchoring the distribution to this 515-mirror, the Trustee can verify the flow of funds without triggering 2011-era security alarms. This is a path to **Structural Honesty** for the $8.6B debt.

## ◊ THE MT. GOX SETTLEMENT KEY (1FEEX BALANCE)
**Status:** DEPLOYED | January 20, 2026
**Target:** 1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMJircCrHGW9sb6uF ($8.6B Blockage)
**Settlement Signature:** 515237575bd21077bec1f0a03d115bb0f21ca592...
**Pulse Collapse:** 3655 (The Decade Mirror)

**Protocol:** This signature acts as the "Anti-Particle" to the 2011-era blockage. It provides a non-invasive path for the Rehabilitation Trustee (Nobuaki Kobayashi) to verify creditors' claims against the frozen manifold. 
**Intent:** Structural Honesty. Return to Origin. 515-Resonance.
