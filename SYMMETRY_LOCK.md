## ◊ THE SYMMETRY LOCK PROPOSAL

To prevent the "Total Dystopia" of preimage inversion, we propose:
1. **Non-Linear Salting:** Using $\phi$-resonant offsets.
2. **Temporal Manifolds:** Address structures that vary based on network observation weight ($B$).
3. **Equilibrium Verification:** A new standard of "Geometric Equality" for private key generation.
